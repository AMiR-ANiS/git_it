Git is a version control system

rollout features of a project

a, b, c: features

timeline: a --- b --- c 

b : comments, c : likes

feature likes not working after its rollout, go back to feature b, fix the bug in c then rollout c again, to not lose the user base.
User base multiplies after every rollout.

solution: keep a copy of every rollout feature in a folder

repository : folders

Every feature of the project is a version (a, b, c). In each version either a new file is created or any existing file is updated.

git init
git status
